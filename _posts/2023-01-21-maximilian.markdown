I have been working as a Software Developer for nearly six years now. 
Focusing on web development, whereby I enjoy frontend development the most. Building visually appealing modules, creating designs that underline content storytelling to get and keep the attention of users is my personal passion. 
Obviously, the development of front- and backend have to be in balance, because without the right backend, even the most beautiful frontend can‘t assure to achieve goals. 
What I enjoy most at work? Working on a specific, innovative product with a clear vision and improving it day by day through my development skills and customer feedback. 
As a balance to my computer job, I work as a licensed road cycling coach for young people.
